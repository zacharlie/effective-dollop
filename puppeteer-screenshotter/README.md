# Puppeteer Screenshotter

Capture a screenshot with a vanilla javascript function using the puppeteer library.

This is a simple example on how to create a puppeteer script that you can invoke as a function to perform browser actions and return a result, such as save a screenshot using raw javascript in your nodejs applications (after closing a cookie notice or something).

This example returns a screenshot as a base64 encoded string and the calling operation saves the decoded base63 result to a file.

## Usage

Install Dependencies [you should use pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```sh
pnpm i
```

Execute:

```sh
pnpm run dosomethingfancy
```
